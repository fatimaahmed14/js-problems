# Pseudo Code Solution

The Problem:
If you list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, you'll get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Pseudo Code:
<!-- let total to 0 beacsue we will cahnge the value later
open up a loop that run i = 0 to i <1000
specifiy with an if statement that we want to % i by 3 and 5 with a remainder of 0
total needs to += with these muliples 
console log the total to check> -->
